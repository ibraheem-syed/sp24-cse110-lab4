1. Line 12 prints the value of i after the for loop is done executing
2. On line 13 the value in discountedPrice is printed which is 150
3. On line 14 the value of finalPrice is printed which is also 150
4. The function returns an array of discounted values
5. Line 12 throws an error because i isnt defined in the codeblock
6. Line 13 throws an error because discountedPrice isn't defined in the codeblock
7. Line 14 prints 150 because finalPrice is defined within the codeblock
8. The function returns an array of discounted values
9. Line 11 throws an error because i isnt defined outside of the loop
10. Line 12 prints 3 which is the length of the inputted list
11. The function returns an array of discounted values
12. a: student.name;
    b: student['Grad Year'];
    c: student.greeting();
    d: student['Favorite Teacher'].name;
    e: student.courseLoad[0]; 
13. a: '32' because 2 maps to the string value '2' which is concatenated with '3'
    b: 1 because '3' maps to the integer value 3 and 2 is subtracted from it
    c: 3 because null doesnt add anything to 3 as an integer value
    d: '3null' because null maps to 'null' as a string value and it's concatenated with '3'
    e: 4 because true maps to 1 as an integer value
    f: 0 because false maps to 0 and null doesn't add anything
    g: '3undefined' because undefined maps to 'undefined' as a string and it gets concatenated with '3'
    h: NaN or "not a number" because we cannot subtract undefined from '3' converted to an int
14. a: true because '2' maps to 2 which is greater than 1
    b: false because it compares them as strings and as strings '2' is > '12'
    c: true because '2' gets converted to an integer when comparing
    d: false because they are differemt types
    e: false because true is 1 as an integer value which isnt equal to 1
    f: true because Boolean(2) evaluates to true
15. == tries to convert the types and compare, === tries to compare only if they are the same type, if they are a different type it returns false
17. The result will be [2,4,6]. This is because the array 1,2,3 is passed in along with the doSomething function which multiplies its input by 2. Inside the function there is a loop that loops through and passes each array item into the function and pushes the result into a new array which is then returned. 
19. The code outputs 1 4 3 2. It does this because the times are set different for when 2 and 3 are printed.
